# FightingCovid
## Description
This is my capstone project which was made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as the base for the project.
Using firebase as the database to extract the data via endpoint API call. The application takes information from an arduino base sanitation station
and the web app uses this information to show users analytics of how each station is progressing. The goal for this project was to make a dashboard UI
so that users could easily navigate and view data.
### Features
- React Redux (global store for state management)
- React Router (used to handle page routes)
- Axios (handles http request)
These are the most important packages I but there are many more you can check out in the package.json file.
